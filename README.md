# Recommendations
1. Install VS Code.
 * Install TSLint and Prettier packages for linting highlighting and code formatting.

# Contributing
Code must be linted (error-free) and tested (>80% coverage) before pull requests will be accepted.

# Getting started
1. `npm install`.
2. `apt install postgres`.
3. `npm run build`.
4. `npm start`.
5. Visit or make requests to `http://localhost:3000`.

# Making changes
1. `npm run build` to compile TS and static assets. TSLint will run as well.
2. `npm run watch` for automatic code compilation; does not compile static assets.

# Testing
