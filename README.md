## Recommendations

1. Run in a Unix environment. Some dependencies won't work on Windows.
2. Install VS Code for better TypeScript support.
3. Install TSLint and Prettier packages for linting highlighting and code formatting.

## Contributing

Code must be linted (error and warning free) and tested (>80% coverage) before pull requests will be accepted.

## Getting started

1. `apt install postgres`.
2. `npm install`.
3. `npm run build`.
4. `npm start`.
5. Visit or make requests to `http://localhost:3000`, if running locally.

## Making changes

1. `npm run build` to compile TS and static assets. TSLint will run as well.
2. `npm run watch` for automatic code compilation; does not compile static assets.

## Testing

1. `npm run test`.
